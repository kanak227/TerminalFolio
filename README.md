  "description": "Welcome message and instructions",
  "specialCommands": {
    "commandName": {
      "output": "Command output text or HTML",
      "description": "Command description for help menu"
    },
    "functionCommand": {
      "output": "functionName",
      "description": "Description for function-based command",
      "isFunction": true
    }
  },
  "socials": {
    "github": "<a href=\"https://github.com/yourusername\">github.com/yourusername</a>",
    "linkedin": "<a href=\"https://linkedin.com/in/yourusername\">linkedin.com/in/yourusername</a>"
  }
}
```

## Updating Your Portfolio Data

To update your portfolio details, edit the `src/config/user.json` file. Modify the fields as needed:

- `"name"`: Your full name.
- `"email"`: Your contact email.
- `"bio"`: A short description about yourself.
- `"resume"`: A link to your resume (Google Drive, website, etc.).
- `"socials"`: Links to your social profiles.
- `"projects"`: A list of your projects with a name, description, and link.

### Example:

```json
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "bio": "Full-stack developer interested in cloud and AI.",
  "resume": "https://example.com/jane-resume.pdf",
  "socials": {
    "github": "https://github.com/janedoe",
    "linkedin": "https://linkedin.com/in/janedoe",
    "twitter": "https://twitter.com/janedoe"
  },
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Task Manager App",
      "description": "A web-based task management system using React and Firebase.",
      "link": "https://github.com/janedoe/task-manager"
    }
  ]
}

Simply update the values in user.json, and your portfolio will reflect the changes automatically.


### Adding New Commands:

To add a new special command, simply add it to the `specialCommands` object in `commands.json`.

For function-based commands that require JavaScript execution, set `isFunction` to `true` and implement the function in the `script.js` file.
